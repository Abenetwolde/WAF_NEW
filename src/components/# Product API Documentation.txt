## Introduction
This product API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing and retrieving product data. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete products, as well as filter and search for products based on various criteria. The API is designed to be flexible and scalable, making it suitable for a wide range of e-commerce applications.

## Prerequisites
